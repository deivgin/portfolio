# Transitioning to the IT sector

I have noticed recently that a lot of people are thinking about entering the software development space. From friends, family, to complete strangers, it seems that the recent boom of IT sector is becoming more and more main stream. Personally, this makes me excited, as with anything that you have passion for, seeing more people interested in that space creates that happy feeling, makes me want to share and to talk about it on and on. So in this post I’ll try to share with you ways to get started in the software development sphere, either as a starting career path, or for someone who is thinking of switching.

## Choose your career path

Contrary to popular belief, IT sector does not consist mostly of developers. Whilst it is an essential part, other roles have a huge impact to development that do not require you to code at all. So before learning anything, decide what role seems to interest you the most. Do you want to code? Do you want to assure good product quality? Do you want to manage product or project, or perhaps the day to day itself.

### Some roles that you can choose from

1. Developer - most common one, can be separated further into more specific type of developer, for example, currently I am a Frontend developer. That means I code with web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. There can be many different types depending of what coding language you use, for what platform you code and so on.
2. Quality assurance (or tester) - this role is sort of a between role - a good tester has a good understanding on the underlying principles of development, creates specific type of scripts called tests, that automate his workflow. He also understands the way the system should work, has a deep understanding of it and is able to assure that the product that developers create is to the standards of its requirements.
3. Business analyst - this role does not require you to code. A BA is responsible for communication between what the user (or business) wants from the system being created, how these needs can be implemented by the development team.
4. Product Owner - this position is responsible for the whole product that is created. This person has the larger picture of the product, understands its needs and requirements from both a high and low levels. Communicates with business side and development team.
5. Scrum master - many companies work with agile principles of work, use variety of methodologies (at our company we try to use SCRUM as close as possible, but any methodology is flexible to the teams needs) and in SCRUM development the SCRUM master is responsible that everything is run smoothly. He organizes SCRUM ceremonies (meetings and work methods), ensures that the developer has everything he needs to finish his work, helps the team plan and execute their tasks, removes any blocker and anything else that the team needs.

## What to learn
