# Continuing to function

There often come times where I go from super motivated and excited about life to being lazy and low energy, with this deep sense of sadness coming from within. These periods come and go and I tend to expect them to creep up at some point, sooner or later. Whilst I realize, that most likely many people experience this, it doesn’t take away the difficulty of functioning whilst in that state of mind. First few were hard to go through, but I managed to get myself out of them and subsequent ones seem way more manageable and I have faith in my ability to continue chugging on. Since whilst writing this post I am in one of these (a quite tame one comparatively) I thought why not share my discoveries.

### Maintain

A super important part is maintenance. One thing that I try to do (sometimes unsuccessfully) is to keep up with my habits that I find important to me. Maintaining what was there during good periods ensures me that when coming out of a bad mental state I can easily hop back in to doing what is important to me. These habits can be continuing to go to the gym (though perhaps not giving 100% effort), keeping my hygiene, continuing to my work flow tasks and being productive at work or simply saying yes to social events. To ensure that a sad period doesn’t turn in to a depressing one I try to catch myself slipping and continuing on the work that I started whilst motivated. Maintaining what is there and what is good for me ensures that I can recover quickly and have minimal damage done to my day to day. That is why I try to create a [basic](https://www.reiz.tech/post/the-basics) productivity system, so that when these harder times come I do not crumble and continue functioning.

### Understanding myself

A big reason to why I started this journey of self discovery is to understand why I feel a certain way, why I do what I do and how I can change my toxic thought or self destructing behaviours. In order to do that I try to really look and analyze myself. That is [why I write](https://www.reiz.tech/post/road-to-self-discovery). So probably the biggest help for when I feel I am having a mental breakdown I write in my journal. It helps me get all the rushing thoughts onto something physical, so that I can control the storm in my brain and see what it is I am manic about. Often times this helps me calm down and realize that these thought are unimportant, sometimes I realize something new, discover an new part of me or decide to try something different. I am a huge proponent of journaling and writing during tougher periods of life helps me get through them more smoothly and more quickly.

### Practice

During this months mental distress I have made a quite pleasant discovery - I seem to be able to manage it quite well. Not only is it a bit shorter but the periods when I am alone or when I need to focus come more easily and naturally, and when I do feel this surge of anxiety and sadness come through, the techniques that I found and tried do work. I breath, try to be present, try talking to myself, exercise write and anything else that come to mind. And it all does work for me. These emotions no longer control me as they once did. And I think that is all I can do - try making things, myself, better. During larger life’s crises these small tricks wont solve what it is you are going through, but in addition to professional help they can alleviate some of the suffering and help heal faster, well, at least that is what I believe.

So, this is what I do for when difficult times come. I try to catch myself at the very beginning, do what I know works for me, write and think, and most importantly - I experiment, change things up and put into practice new or true and tested techniques to survive and continue functioning. It is important for me to learn how to keep up with my responsibilities even when hard times come, and they most likely will, so that I am not caught off guard and completely break down. This way I can keep progressing, learning, producing and perhaps in doing so - find the meaning in it all.

## Notes:

For this months blog I think I should write about how to keep on chugging when shit is hard and all you want to do is lay in bed and chill.

Write more about my struggles and findings, don’t give advice - who the fuck are you to give advice?

- Have the intro be more personal, discussing why this theme was chosen.
- Still doing maintenance is important
- All these basic advice are dumb and gay
- Don’t feel bad about slacking off, bro you sad just chill
